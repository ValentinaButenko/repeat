# üöÄ Complete Deployment Guide

## Quick Decision Tree

### Do you want your code visible to everyone?

**YES** ‚Üí Keep repo **public**  
**NO** ‚Üí Make repo **private**

### Do you want anyone to use your deployed app?

**YES** ‚Üí Don't set `APP_ACCESS_PASSWORD`  
**NO** ‚Üí Set `APP_ACCESS_PASSWORD` (see [ACCESS_CONTROL.md](ACCESS_CONTROL.md))

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Open Source + Public App
*"I want to share my code AND let anyone use the app"*

- ‚úÖ Repo: **Public**
- ‚úÖ Password: **Not set**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Don't add your OpenAI key (or accept the cost)
- üí° Users can deploy their own instance with the one-click button

**Good for:** Portfolio projects, learning resources, community apps

---

### Scenario 2: Open Source + Private App (RECOMMENDED)
*"I want to share my code but only specific users can use my deployed instance"*

- ‚úÖ Repo: **Public**
- ‚úÖ Password: **Set** (`APP_ACCESS_PASSWORD`)
- ‚úÖ OpenAI Key: **Your own** (safe because password protects it)
- üí° Best of both worlds!

**Good for:** Sharing with friends/family while showcasing code

**Setup:**
```bash
# On Vercel/Netlify, set:
APP_ACCESS_PASSWORD=YourSecretPassword123
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
```

---

### Scenario 3: Private Code + Private App
*"I don't want anyone to see my code or use my app (except invited users)"*

- ‚úÖ Repo: **Private**
- ‚úÖ Password: **Set** (`APP_ACCESS_PASSWORD`)
- ‚úÖ OpenAI Key: **Your own**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è One-click deploy won't work for others

**Good for:** Proprietary projects, commercial apps

---

### Scenario 4: Private Code + Public App
*"I want to hide my code but let anyone use the app"*

- ‚úÖ Repo: **Private**
- ‚úÖ Password: **Not set**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Don't add your OpenAI key (or accept the cost)

**Good for:** Protecting IP while providing free service

---

## Your Situation (Most Likely)

Based on your questions, you probably want **Scenario 2**:

### üìã Checklist

- [ ] Keep GitHub repo **PUBLIC** (great for portfolio!)
- [ ] Push all the new code to GitHub
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel
- [ ] Set `APP_ACCESS_PASSWORD=YourSecretPassword` in Vercel environment variables
- [ ] Set `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...` in Vercel environment variables
- [ ] Share your app URL + password with chosen users
- [ ] Done! üéâ

### What This Gives You

‚úÖ Your code is visible on GitHub (portfolio!)  
‚úÖ Only users with password can access deployed app  
‚úÖ Your OpenAI API key is protected from unauthorized use  
‚úÖ You control who uses your AI features  
‚úÖ Others can still deploy their own instance if they want  
‚úÖ No cost from random strangers  

## Step-by-Step: Full Setup

### 1. Push Your Code

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add deployment configs and access control"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Deploy to Vercel

1. Go to [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new)
2. Select your `repeat` repository
3. Click "Import"

### 3. Add Environment Variables

In Vercel deployment settings, add:

| Name | Value | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | `sk-...` | Your OpenAI key for AI features |
| `APP_ACCESS_PASSWORD` | `SecretPass123` | Restricts app access |

### 4. Deploy

Click "Deploy" and wait ~2 minutes.

### 5. Test

Visit your app URL (e.g., `repeat-xyz.vercel.app`)

- You should see a login page
- Enter your password
- You're in!

### 6. Share

Send to your users:
- üîó URL: `https://repeat-xyz.vercel.app`
- üîë Password: `SecretPass123`

## Managing Access

### Add New Users
Just share the URL + password with them.

### Remove User Access
Change the password in Vercel and redeploy. All existing sessions are invalidated.

### Temporarily Disable Access
Set `APP_ACCESS_PASSWORD` to a very long random string that only you know.

### Make Public Again
Delete `APP_ACCESS_PASSWORD` from environment variables and redeploy.

## Cost Estimates

### With Password Protection (10 active users)

Assuming each user generates 20 cards/week:
- 10 users √ó 20 cards √ó 4 weeks = 800 cards/month
- Cost: ~$0.08/month with gpt-4o-mini

**Very affordable!**

### Without Password Protection (Public)

Could be anyone... potentially hundreds of users.
- **Risky** if you have your OpenAI key configured
- **Safe** if you don't set any API keys (app uses free services)

## FAQ

**Q: If my repo is public, can people see my API key?**  
A: No! API keys are stored as environment variables on Vercel/Netlify, never in your code.

**Q: If my repo is private, does that protect my deployed app?**  
A: No! The deployed app URL is still publicly accessible. Use `APP_ACCESS_PASSWORD` instead.

**Q: Can someone steal my password from the code?**  
A: No! The password is stored as an environment variable, never in your code.

**Q: What if someone shares the password?**  
A: Change it in Vercel settings and redeploy. You can also implement more advanced auth (see [AUTH_OPTIONS.md](AUTH_OPTIONS.md)).

**Q: Is this password protection secure enough?**  
A: For protecting API costs and casual use, yes! For highly sensitive data, consider OAuth (see [AUTH_OPTIONS.md](AUTH_OPTIONS.md)).

**Q: Can I use both password protection AND make repo private?**  
A: Yes! That's Scenario 3. You get double protection.
